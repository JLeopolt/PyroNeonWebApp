    About
  </h1>
  <p>
    Scraps is a custom-plugin based Minecraft server, which modifies gameplay and aspects of survival. Inspired by online base-building survival
    games like Rust, starve.io, and Minecraft Factions, this custom server adds unique game features which make it truly stand out from any other game
    or minecraft server.

  <h1>
    How To Play
  </h1>
  <p>
    Since Scraps is a vanilla minecraft server, no mods or fancy resource packs are required to play. Simply log into minecraft and connect to the server!
    Scraps is completely free to play, and nothing needs to be downloaded.
