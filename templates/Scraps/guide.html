          Welcome to the official Scraps Game Guide! Whether you're a new player who wants to know what you're in for, or just looking for helpful tips
          and tricks, you've come to the right place. Before you get started, you should know that Scraps is an online experience, and PyroNeon Software is
          not responsible for what individuals do on our server. By playing on our server, you are agreeing to our server-rules, and will be held accountable
          for any rules you break on our server. Severe or repeated rule violations may result in account or IP bans from our servers.

        <h3>
          The First Steps
        </h3>
        <p>
          When you hop into the game for the first time ever, you will find yourself in the wilderness. This is one of the most difficult stages of the game.
          If you were unlucky enough to spawn in an arctic region or at night-time, you will probably start freezing to death. This is one of the many new
          survival features added to the game; <a href="#temperature">Temperature</a>.

        <h3>
          Temperature
        </h3>
        <p>
          The new Temperature mechanic causes you to suffer from frostbite whenever you are exposed to the sky, during the night in most biomes, and all day in the Snowy Biome.
          Frostbite can be prevented by standing close to a light source like a campfire, but the frost may continue damaging you for a period of time until it finally wears off.
          Wearing more than 3 pieces of armor will keep you warm, and one piece of leather armor is all that is required to keep you from taking damage.
          Wearing armor will not protect you during the night time in the snowy biome.
