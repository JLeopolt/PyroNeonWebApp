      The First Steps

    <p>
      When you hop into the game for the first time ever, you will find yourself in the wilderness. This is one of the most difficult stages of the game.
      If you were unlucky enough to spawn in an arctic region or at night-time, you will probably start freezing to death. This is one of the many new
      survival features added to the game; <a href="#temperature"> Temperature </a>.
