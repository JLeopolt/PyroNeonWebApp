          Before You Start

        <p>
          Welcome to the official Scraps Game Guide! Whether you're a new player who wants to know what you're in for, or just looking for helpful tips
          and tricks, you've come to the right place. Before you get started, you should know that Scraps is an online experience, and PyroNeon Software is

        <h3>
          The First Steps
        </h3>
        <p>
          When you hop into the game for the first time ever, you will find yourself in the wilderness. This is one of the most difficult stages of the game.
          If you were unlucky enough to spawn in an arctic region or at night-time, you will probably start freezing to death. This is one of the many new
          survival features added to the game; <a href="#temperature">Temperature</a>. If you die, it's not a big deal. It's very likely that you will die on your
          first few tries before you can build a base. Just focus on getting out of the cold however you can, whether by hiding out by a campfire or finding clothes. You
          should also look for some food if possible, sometimes provisions can be found in monuments. Try to avoid other players if possible. If you are adequately
          warm and have some food for the time being, you can start gathering wood and exploring. Once you have stone tools, start mining. You'll need three
          copper ingots to craft a <a href="#lockbox">Lockbox</a>, which is necessary for your base. Smelt your copper ore and craft the lockbox, you're now ready
          to build a starter base!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="starter-base" style="padding-top: 2ch; padding-bottom: 1ch;">
        <h3>
          Your Starter Base
        </h3>
        <p>
          Once you have a lockbox and some resources, you can start building. Since you're just starting out, you should build your base out of wood. Wood is readily
          available, easy and cheap to collect, and regenerates rapidly. Wood is a pretty crappy building material, however. Wood is very vulnerable to explosives
          and is also uniquely susceptible to fire <a href="#raid-chart">see the Raid Chart for more info</a>. You should have enough room in your base to store plenty of
          loot for the future, and you should hopefully have a bed. Make sure there is room around your bed for you to respawn at, or you might find yourself respawning
          outside your house! Keep your lockbox as deep in your base as possible, if it falls, your invaders will be able to open your doors and gain control of the whole
          base! Don't cheap out on your base, whenever you find some juicy loot or get into trouble with another player, you should upgrade your base, just to be on the safe
          side. If you have a wooden base, a single player with a flint and steel could be disasterous. That's why you want to upgrade your base as soon as possible.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="base-design" style="padding-top: 2ch; padding-bottom: 1ch;">
        <h3>
          Base Design
        </h3>
        <p>
          Congratulations! You should have a quaint starter base at this point! Now you have somewhere to keep your loot safe, and you can afford to take riskier plays and
          start interacting with other people. In the future, you are going to have to upgrade your base. For example, a common feature you might want to add is a small
          wheat/potato/carrot farm. Farming food is a great way to guarantee a food supply. For this, you are going to need a large space to grow the food. One good idea
          is to build your farm out of cheaper materials, but split it up into different rooms. That way, if a raider manages to break in, they only have access to one
          chunk of your farm, instead of the whole thing. Modularity is key for good base design. Whenever you expand your base, it's best to add onto your base instead of
          removing parts of it. For example, instead of tearing down a wall, you can add a door going around it, or figure out some way to safely expand. Leaving your base
          in an exposed state, even for a few minutes, is very risky.

      <section id="how-to-raid" style="padding-top: 2ch; padding-bottom: 1ch;">
        <h3>
          How To Raid
        </h3>
        <p>
          Have you been bothered by other players yet? Maybe a rival tried to stake out your base and catch you off guard? Or maybe someone keeps looting your favorite
          monument? In that case, you might want to tell them off face to face, by blowing a hole through their base. The first step to raiding someone is finding where
          they live. There are many ways to find bases to raid, for example, by stealthily stalking someone back to their home, or by roaming the wilderness searching for
          other players. If you're looking to profit from your raid, then keep an eye on the person who lives in it. If you know for a fact someone has explosives in
          their base, or if they've been raiding other people recently, you can probably fetch a nice profit by raiding them. However, their base might be extremely well defended.
          In any case, you can't 100% guarantee how much you profit off a raid. Try to gather as much information as you can, however you can. Once you have your target, hit them
          hard while they're off guard. The ideal time to raid is when they're out and about. Be wary though! Explosives are very loud, and players can hear them from around the map!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="controlling-territory" style="padding-top: 2ch; padding-bottom: 1ch;">
        <h3>
          Controlling Territory
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you have a strong base, stable loot supply, and plenty of weaponry, you are probably capable of completely controlling your region. You want to keep people away
          from your monuments. You may find yourself killing other players on sight, and quickly destroying any bases that spring up in your territory. Controlling space
          becomes exponentially harder the more space you try to control. If you have friends, or make an alliance with your neighbors, it can be much easier. This is the strategy
          many late-game players employ. Countering someone trying to control territory is very dangerous, and can be almost impossible alone. To successfully counter and weaken
          a controlling player, you want as many people wreaking as much havoc as possible on their precious land. You can try to bait out counter-raiders and the controller by
          blowing up explosives nearby. When counter-raiders rush to the bait, your controller might be distracted. At that time, you can raid the controller without any hassle.

          Base Building Tips

        <p>
          - Keep your base modular, with many individual rooms.<br><br>
          - Always take the extra mile to upgrade your base. <br><br>
          - Try not to leave your base unattended too long. <br><br>
          - Make sure no one knows where you live. Keep them guessing. <br><br>
          - Always have an airlock at your front door, to prevent players going deep in your base. <br><br>
          - Put a window room next to your front door, to check if anyone's camping out your base. <br><br>
          - Your ceiling and floor should be as strong as your walls. <br><br>
          - Build a tower on your base to keep an eye on other players.

          Miscellaneous Tips

        <p>
          - Oxidized copper is easier to break.<br><br>
          - Creepers do not spawn naturally.<br><br>
          - Players spawn with less HP and less hunger than normal.<br><br>
          - Players will get hungry twice as fast.<br><br>
          - Explosives can destroy Water and Lava blocks.<br><br>
          - Obsidian is not a very good block to build bases from, due to its relatively quick mining time.<br><br>
          - Players cannot reach the Nether or End dimension.<br><br>
          - Endermen and Creepers will both drop rotten flesh instead of their vanilla loot.<br><br>
          - Since the underground resets, DON'T build a base underground, because it will be wiped overnight.<br><br>
          - Offline raiding is widely frowned upon, but is not technically against the rules.<br><br>
          - Fire Charges will fire a weak explosive fireball projectile.<br><br>
          - Flint and Steels do not have a 100% chance to start a fire.

          Temperature
        </h3>
        <p>
          The new Temperature mechanic causes you to suffer from frostbite whenever you are exposed to the sky, during the night in most biomes, and all day in the Snowy Biome.
          Frostbite can be prevented by standing close to a light source like a campfire, but the frost may continue damaging you for a period of time until it finally wears off.
          Wearing more than 3 pieces of armor will keep you warm, and one piece of leather armor is all that is required to keep you from taking damage.
          Wearing armor will not protect you during the night time in the snowy biome.

          Hunger
        </h3>
        <p>
          You will get hungry twice as fast in Scraps. It is crucial that you secure a stable food source before you can start fighting other players and exploring the
          wilderness. Some manage to get by through scavenged rations, but having a farm or some other stable, consistent food source is ideal. On your first run, you
          may die of starvation or become too weak to build a starter base if you don't stay on top of your hunger bar. You can create high tier food in the new custom
          Kitchen Workstation (Smoker) and the Stew Pot (Water Cauldron).

          Random Spawning

        <p>
          Whenever you die without a bed, or join for the first time, you will be spawned on a random position along the shoreline or along a river, in any biome.
          If you build too close to these rivers, you may find players spawning inside of your base. If you sleep in a bed, you will respawn at your bed instead.

        <h3>
          Multiple Beds

        <p>
          Beds can only be owned by ONE person. Any player who right clicks on a bed claims it for themselves, and it will be added to the top of their Respawn Point List.
          Players can view and modify their respawn point list using the command /beds.
          Destroyed beds will be removed from their owner’s respawn point list, so if a bed is missing from your list, it was either claimed by a different person, or destroyed.
          You will always respawn at the bed at the top of your respawn list, which can be viewed using /beds list. To rename a bed, use /beds rename <oldname> <newname>,
          and to reorder a bed, use /beds set <bedname> <index> (Indices start from 1 upwards).
          If no beds are present in your respawn list, you will be spawned <a href="#random-spawning">randomly</a>.

          You may have noticed that tree leaves will sometimes plant saplings under them upon decaying. This is one of the ways wood will regeneration naturally to keep the game fun and
          fair for everyone. Another regeneration mechanic is the Ore Regeneration cycle. Ores will be regenerated from y=-63 to y=64 throughout the game.
          Everything between those y levels will be reset during this regeneration, including player bases or tunnels. Do not build underground or your buildings will be reset.

          You may have noticed that certain blocks in the <a href="#raid-chart">Raid Chart</a> are mineable. Every time you attempt to mine the block, instead of being destroyed,
          the block will have a chance to lose one durability. The chance to damage the block is about 10%.

        <p>
          Some blocks are flammable, especially Spruce blocks. Flammable blocks will take 1 damage every time a fire block tries to destroy it. Fire has a lower chance of spreading,
          and it has a chance to extinguish itself when trying to destroy a block.

        The Lockbox
      </h3>
      <p>
        Now that you’re ready to settle down and build a shit shack to protect your loot, you will need to use a special item called the Lock Box. The LockBox is just a
        regular beehive block, however, it has added functionality. By placing down a LockBox, a radius of 20 blocks around it (extending from the bottom of the world to the top)
        will be under your control. A LockBox is used to lock doors and chests, to prevent unauthorized players from entering your base. It can also prevent other players from
        building on your territory. NOTE: Other players can still BREAK blocks on your territory! So be sure to use strong building materials to prevent others from blowing up your base!
        (See <a href="#raid-chart">Raid Chart</a>) Anyone who can reach your LockBox will be able to authorize themselves. Admins on a LockBox can break blocks without reduced mining speed.
        <i>LockBox controls are: RIGHT CLICK - Authorize yourself, SHIFT + RIGHT CLICK - Remove yourself, LEFT CLICK - View admins, SHIFT + LEFT CLICK - Remove all authorized users.</i>

        Monuments
      </h3>
      <p>
        Monuments are regions where no players can build, break, or destroy blocks with explosives/fire. Players can open doors and chests in monuments.
        Monument regions do NOT extend the entire world height, but rather a radius up and down. Monuments may have loot containers inside,
        which use Loot Tables to generate random items inside. Loot containers will refill randomly. They will refill no matter what is inside them,
        so don’t put any items inside them, or they may be despawned.
