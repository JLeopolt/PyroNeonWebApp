              Base Building Tips

            <p>
              <li>Your floor and ceiling should be as strong as your walls.</li>
              <li>Each room in your base should be made of the same strenght material. The weakest link breaks first.</li>
              <li>Since the underground resets, DON'T build a base underground, because it could be reset overnight.</li>
              <li>Iron doors can be opened by right-clicking them.</li>
              <li>Keep your base modular with many separate, individual loot rooms.</li>
              <li>Always go the extra mile to upgrade your base.</li>
              <li>Try not to leave your base unattended for too long.</li>
              <li>Make sure no one knows where you live. Keep them guessing.</li>
              <li>Always have an airlock at your front door, to prevent players from going deep in your base.</li>
              <li>Put a window room next to your front door, to check if anyone's camping behind your door.</li>
              <li>You can build a tower on your base to keep an eye on other players.</li>

            <h3>
              Miscellaneous Tips
            </h3>
            <p>
              <li>Copper blocks lose durability as they oxidize.</li>
              <li>Use the command '/combatlog' to view how much damage you dealt something with a gun.</li>
              <li>Creepers do not spawn naturally.</li>
              <li>Players spawn with less HP and less hunger than normal.</li>
              <li>Players will get hungry twice as fast.</li>
              <li>Explosives can destroy Water and Lava blocks (including source blocks).</li>
              <li>Obsidian is not a very good block to build bases from, due to its relatively quick mining time.</li>
              <li>Players cannot reach the Nether or End dimension.</li>
              <li>Offline raiding is widely frowned upon, but is not technically against the rules.</li>
