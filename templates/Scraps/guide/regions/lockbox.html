          <p>
            The Lockbox is a custom block that can be crafted with a vanilla crafting table.
            It defines a region where only authorized players are able to build, and interact with certain blocks like containers and doors.
            Additionally, some redstone items like levers, buttons, trapdoors, dispensers, etc. are also interaction-protected. However, pressure plates are not.

          <p>
            When you decide on a location for your base, place the lockbox first to ensure you are allowed to secure that region.
            Lockbox regions are not allowed to overlap other lockbox regions, or <a href="./monument">Monument Regions</a>, and must be built far
            away from any other claimed regions. Upon placing the lockbox, you will automatically have privilege over the region. However, if you want
            to give privileges to a friend as well, they must right click on the lockbox themselves to gain privileges.
            Lockboxes have no restriction on the maximum number of admins.
          </p>

          <h3 id="region">Region</h3>
          <p>
            Lockboxes will secure a 40x40 square region, extending all y-levels. The radius of a lockbox is 20 blocks in either direction.
            Other players will not be able to build/place blocks in your region, or interact with doors/containers.
            Players with lockbox privileges will be able to 'fast-mine' durability blocks within the region.
          </p>
