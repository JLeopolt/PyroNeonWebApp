          <p>
            The Scraps guide is a convenient resource for players looking for help while playing Scraps. To use the guide, start from the <a href="/scraps/guide/index">Index</a>, where
            all the articles on the website are listed in a single place. The index can also be searched with the search bar at the top of the page. Most articles contain a summary
            paragraph at the top of the page, a table of contents where each section of the article can be jumped to, and several different sections with their own distinct headers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The sidebar to the left contains quick-reference links to the homepage, abstract page, index, contacts, and more. The top header of the page contains toggles for light/dark mode,
            and redundant links to the index and other important pages in the guide.
          </p>
