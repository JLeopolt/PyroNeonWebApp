          <p><a href="/scraps/join">Scraps</a> is a custom-plugin based <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us">Minecraft</a> server, developed by <a href="https://www.pyroneon.net/">PyroNeon Software</a>.</p>
          <p>
            The game was inspired by Minecraft 'Factions', <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/">RUST</a>, and <a href="starve.io">starve.io</a>.
            Scraps introduces new items, weapons, blocks, and mechanics through a custom plugin and resource pack. It is currently free-to-play through an open beta.
            The server address is <a href="/scraps/join">scraps.pyroneon.net</a>. Since the server is plugin-based, no client-side mods are required. The server supports the
            latest release of Minecraft Java Edition. Certain client-mods are allowed, such as using a custom launcher like Lunar Client, or using Optifine or shaderpacks. Please
            review the <a href="/scraps/join">server rules</a> before connecting, as breaking the rules can result in your account being banned from the server permanently.
          </p>
          <p>The server resets periodically, in a monthly 'wipe'. After the wipe, the world is reset to its original state and all players' progress is reset.</p>

					<h2 id="about">About</h2>
  					<h3 id="plugin">Plugin</h3>
              <p>
                Scraps is based on a custom-plugin, which can be referred to as the core plugin. The official Scraps production server may also include additional plugins, such as
                <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/">ViaVersion</a> (for version compatibility). The Scraps plugin is currently closed-source, and not available
                to the public or to other servers. In the <a href="#future">Future</a>, this may be subject to change.
              </p>
            <h3 id="discord">Discord</h3>
              <p>
                The Scraps server is connected to our <a href="/discord">official Discord server</a>, where the status of the server, active players, in-game-chat, death messages, etc. can all be
                viewed through the #igc channel. This integration allows players to get a sense of what's happening on the server, even when they aren't at their computer.
              </p>
            <h3 id="resource-pack">Resource Pack</h3>
              <p>
                Upon connecting to the Scraps server, you will automatically be prompted to download the Scraps official resource pack. Our resource pack includes fancy 3d models for custom blocks,
                game features, items, weapon attachments, grenades, explosive devices, stations, and more. Our resource pack also uses third-party assets for gun models. Each gun in the game is automatically
                given a lore tag with the author of the model, and the command '/credits' can be used in-game to view all the third-party authors and the models they created.
              </p>

					<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
            <h3 id="regeneration">Regeneration</h3>
              <p>
                Scraps has a static map that regenerates resources periodically, with the assistance of multiple new regeneration mechanics. The main method of obtaining resources during
                gameplay is through looting loot-boxes and chests which exist throughout the world, within monument regions. Loot-boxes will regenerate over time, giving players an incentive
                to build near monuments which contain high-value loot.
              </p>

            <h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
              <p>
                One of the most important new environmental mechanics in Scraps is coldness. Coldness will cause players to move more slowly, and can deal damage to players when severe enough.
                Players can avoid freezing by staying away from cold biomes, wearing 'warm' armor, staying near a light source, or by hiding in a house away from skylight.
                The day/night cycle and weather will affect how cold you feel. Players get colder at night, and much colder during a snowstorm.
              </p>

            <h3 id="raiding">Raiding</h3>
              <p>
                The core gameplay revolves around claimed regions, which are claimed through the use of a Lockbox, a custom block which allows a player to hold exclusive building privilege over an area.
                Players build bases with special 'durability blocks', a kind of block that has a custom data value associated with it, storing it's current health. Durability blocks can be destroyed
                by multiple means, such as explosives, fire damage, or by being mined repeatedly. Players can embark on raids against one another, attempting to breach a base's defenses and reaching the
                Lockbox, which once accessed, can be cleared and claimed for the raider, giving them privilege over the base, and allowing them to secure the base and gain full control over it.
              </p>

            <h3 id="weapons">Weapons</h3>
              <p>
                Scraps v2.0.0-beta introduced an overhauled weapons system to the game. The new weapons system brought
                new guns, like pistols, shotguns, SMGs, rifles, snipers, a grenade launcher, and a rocket launcher;
                new ammunition variants like hollow-point, full-metal-jacket, incendiary, explosive, less-lethal rounds, 40mm grenade rounds, and multiple rocket variants;
                a modular attachment system for guns including red-dot sights, extended magazines, burst triggers, suppressors;
                new grenades including fragmentation grenades, pipe bombs, molotov cocktails;
                and an overhaul to the existing explosives system, with all-new explosive devices and a more advanced ray-tracing algorithm for calculating explosive damage.
              </p>

          <h2 id="history">History</h2>
            <h3 id="development">Development</h3>
              <p>
                Development on Scraps began in early March, 2022. In fact, the first experimental version of the game was completed in a single week. This early version of the game was
                barebones, but laid a foundation for the early explosives system, loot-regeneration, and region-claiming. An early version of the Scraps map was developed shortly afterwards.
                In August of 2022, the alpha version was tested in a closed-alpha.
              </p>
              <p>
                Later, in early 2023, the beta version of the game was completed and released in an open-beta. This new version brought tons of new content, like the block durability system,
                the ability to own multiple beds, a more in-depth loot regeneration system, and much more.
              </p>
              <p>
                In February of 2024, development on v2.0.0-beta began, which hoped to bring tons of new content, focusing mainly on a new weapons system. v2.0.0-beta was released in June of 2024.
              </p>

          <h2 id="future">Future</h2>
            <h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>
              <p>
                One of the highest-priority updates planned for Scraps is an upgraded map.
                Some other key updates that may be added are: turrets, multi-block structures, more intelligent NPC enemies, and vehicles.
              </p>
            <h3 id="gamemodes">Gamemodes</h3>
              <p>
                Several candidates for new Scraps gamemodes are in consideration for future development, such as a tactical mini-game version of the game, and an MMORPG spin-off gamemode.
                The Scraps core plugin could be reused with relative ease, allowing new gamemodes to share certain features and mechanics with classic Scraps. For example,
                the weapon and explosive systems could be directly ported into a new gamemode, which could make switching between gamemodes more straight-forward for players.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently no new gamemodes have been confirmed due to higher priority projects taking up development time.
              </p>
