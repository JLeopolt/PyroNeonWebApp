            Scraps introduces several new Crafting Stations to the game, which allow the player to create new custom items like weapons, traps, explosives, foods, etc.
            When the player opens the custom GUI with the specified keybind, the crafting station will offer several different recipes for custom items to craft.
            Simply select the item you wish to craft, and if you have the prerequisite resources they will automatically be withdrawn from your inventory. Some items
            like milk buckets and water bottles will return the empty bucket/bottle after crafting along with the product.

            Overview
          </h2>
          <p>
            Crafting Stations are a subset of <a href="./custom-blocks">Custom Blocks</a>, which can all be crafted in a vanilla crafting table.
            Some crafting stations have different 'Tiers', meaning there is another crafting station which has a similar purpose, but offers more advanced crafting recipes.
            However, a higher tier crafting station will NOT provide recipes from lower tier crafting stations. You must have both stations available to be able to craft all
            recipes.
          </p>

          </h2>
          <h3 id="workbench">Workbench</h3>
          <p>
            The workbench is a tier 1 crafting station. Its successor is the <a href="#workstation">Workstation</a>.
            The workbench is used to create weapons, ammunition, traps, weapon attachments, small explosives, and more.
            It can never occur naturally in loot and must be crafted or taken from another player.
          </p>
          <h3 id="workstation">Workstation</h3>
          <p>
            The workstation is a tier 2 crafting station. Its predecessor is the <a href="#workbench">Workbench</a>.
            The workstation can also create weapons, ammunition, and weapons attachments. However, it can also be used to create advanced explosives, like C-4.
            It can never occur naturally in loot and must be crafted or taken from another player.
          </p>
          <h3 id="cauldron">Cooking Cauldron</h3>
          <p>
            The cooking cauldron is a tier 1 crafting station. Its successor is the <a href="#oven">Salvaged Oven</a>.
            The cooking cauldron is exclusively used to create soups and stews (Soups are plant-based, Stews are meat-based).
            In Scraps, all vanilla stews/soups are uncraftable and must be created in a cooking cauldron.
            The cooking cauldron also introduces many new soups/stews, like Borscht, Kelp Stew, Spider Eye Stew, etc.
            Stews and soups can offer a high saturation and hunger value from low-tier food items.
          </p>
          <h3 id="oven">Salvaged Oven</h3>
          <p>
            The salvaged oven is a tier 2 crafting station. Its predecessor is the <a href="#cauldron">Cooking Cauldron</a>.
            The salvaged oven is used to create valuable food items, like cakes, cookies, bread, etc. These high tier foods
            offer a huge amount of saturation and hunger value compared to vanilla food items.
          </p>
          <h3 id="chemistry">Chemistry Station</h3>
          <p>
            The chemistry station does not have a tier, it is a unique crafting station. It can be used to craft more advanced
            potions, such as potions with an infinite duration, non-vanilla potions, and precursors to other items, like plastic
            explosives - which are used to craft advanced explosives like C-4 and HEAT rockets.
