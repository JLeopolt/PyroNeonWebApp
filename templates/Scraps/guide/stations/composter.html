            The Composter is a vanilla block, but in Scraps it has been given more functionality. The composter appears to behave in the same manner as the vanilla composter, but
            once it is fully filled, it will drop a random item instead of bonemeal. The possible items it can drop include: Mycelium, Kelp, Sugar Cane, Bamboo, Red Mushroom, Brown Mushroom.
            Additionally, the composter has a 10% chance to drop Gunpowder. Note, the composter will never drop bonemeal.
