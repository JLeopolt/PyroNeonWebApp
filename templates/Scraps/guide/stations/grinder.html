            The Item Grinder is an unobtainable custom station block, which can be found at
            <a href="/scraps/guide/map/monuments#substations">Substations</a> and the <a href="/scraps/guide/map/monuments#factory">Factory</a>.
            It looks like a stonecutter block, but will display a custom GUI when opened instead of the vanilla GUI.
            The Item Grinder allows players to 'recycle' certain items by breaking them down into their crafting components.
            It's purpose is to allow players to turn unnecessary items into useful raw materials, albeit inefficiently. For example, if a player finds loot they don't need
            at the moment, it may be more practical to grind the item and use the materials to crafting something else, or to build their base.

            To use the Item Grinder, open the GUI and place an item into the inventory. Be careful not to place anything you don't want to destroy into the inventory.
            Once you've confirmed that you want to grind the items in the inventory, close the inventory. Upon exiting the Item Grinder's inventory, it will automatically
            activate and give you a confirmation/error message in your action bar. If the Grinder is functioning properly, you should hear a loud grating noise as it
            works. This noise can be heard for over 20 blocks, so stay alert.
          <p>
            The Item Grinder will grind certain items more quickly than other items, based on their stack size. The Item Grinder is quite inefficient at grinding, so you might
            only get 50% of the crafting cost of the item back. You can grind custom items like ammunition, guns, grenades, lockboxes, etc. in addition to vanilla items.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is no benefit to splitting item stacks or distributing your items evenly across the Grinder, since it will only grind one item at a time anyways.
            Make sure there is plenty of room in the inventory, as the Grinder will automatically turn off when its inventory is too full to continue grinding items.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is dangerous to leave the Grinder unattended, since it's loud noise can attract many other players. However, you could use this to your advantage by camping the
            grinder from a hidden position and waiting for another player to investigate, then ambushing them.
