            The Repair Station allows players to repair their weapons. In Scraps, weapons are given an intrinsic custom durability, which is stored in PersistentDataContainers.
            This custom durability can be more finely adjusted than the vanilla item durability. Since weapons can't be repaired in an anvil like normal, the Repair Station was created
            as a way to allow players to restore durability for their weapons.

            To use the repair station, simply open the GUI and left click on a gun in your inventory. The repair station will display the prerequisite resources required to repair the item, to full
            durability. If you are missing at least ONE of the items in the list, you will not be able to repair the gun at all.
          </p>

          <p>
            The items required to repair a weapon are based on the crafting recipe of the weapon. All items in the crafting recipe must be used in each repair, with at least 1 of each item being used always. However, you
            will never have to use the maximum amount of items to repair a weapon, so it is almost always more efficient to repair a damaged weapon than to craft a new one.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have all the items required, but you don't have enough of one or more items, you will still be able to repair the weapon, but not to full durability.
            Repairs are calculated proportionally, where the LOWEST amount provided / amount required (for each different item) will set a cap as to how much the weapon can be repaired.
            To get the most bang for your buck, you should only repair a gun when it has a low or very low durability, since you will be able to get much more durability restored for less high value materials
            like netherite ingots.
