          <p>
            Due to the nature of Scraps, the vanilla respawn mechanic had to be replaced with a new custom system, to replace the default 'server spawn' location; and to add a cooldown
            to respawning at beds, in order to nerf players from being able to respawn as frequently as they want.

          <h3 id="respawn-menu">Respawn Menu</h3>
          <p>
            Upon dying, you will be put into a state of limbo, and prompted to select a bed to respawn at. If you hadn't claimed any beds, or if your beds were destroyed, you will have no choice
            but to respawn <a href="#random-spawn">randomly</a>. You can always choose to respawn randomly if you want to. You can also select any claimed bed (provided it isn't on cooldown) to
            respawn at instead. The respawn menu will also give you insight as to how far away each claimed bed is from your most recent death location. There is no time limit to respawn, so
            you could remain in the respawn menu until your favorite bed fully cools down to select it. If you are disconnected while in the respawn menu, you will automatically be respawned randomly.
          </p>
          <h3 id="claim-beds">Bed Management</h3>
          <p>
            Any player can claim a bed, regardless whether or not they have building privilege over it. Beds can also be managed through the '/beds' command. The '/beds' command allows the player
            to manage their owned beds in several ways, such as renaming an existing bed, abandoning the bed (unclaiming it without breaking the bed), and gifting the bed to another player on the server.
            Only one player can own a bed at a time, and the original owner will be notified when their bed is claimed by another player.
          </p>

          <!-- Major Title -->
          <h2 id="random-spawn">
            Random Spawning
          </h2>
          <p>
            Whenever you die without a bed, or join for the first time, you will be spawned on a random position along the shoreline or along a river, in any biome.
            If you build too close to these rivers, you may find players spawning inside of your base. If you own a bed, you can choose to respawn at your bed instead
            (See <a href="#beds">Beds</a>).
