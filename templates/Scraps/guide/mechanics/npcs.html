          <p>
            Scraps introduces new NPCs which resemble players in the game for certain mechanics. For example, upon logging out of the server, an NPC 'sleeper'
            will take the player's place. This sleeper will have a health value, and have an inventory associated with the player's inventory.
            Additionally, when a player dies, an NPC 'corpse' spawns in their place containing all the items the player died with. This corpse can be harvested for human flesh
            and in some cases, the player's head.

          <!-- Major Title -->
          <h2 id="sleepers">
            Sleepers
          </h2>
          <p>
            Sleeping NPCs have a health value, and can be killed if they aren't safe inside of a base. R+Click on a sleeping player to access their inventory, in the top
            row of the inventory, the player's armor and offhand slot can be looted. The rest of the inventory contains the contents of their inventory. You can also place
            items into the inventory, and equip armor to a sleeping player. When a sleeping player is killed, the chat is notified, and the player will enter the <a href="./respawn">Respawn Menu</a>
            upon rejoining, instead of waking up where they were.
          </p>

          <h2 id="corpses">Corpses</h2>
          <p>
            When a player dies, a corpse will be spawned on their death location. Corpses are very similar to sleeping players, however they do not have a health value, and items cant be put back
            into their inventories. Items can only be removed from the inventory; new items cannot be inserted into a corpse. A corpse can be harvested by punching it repeatedly. Depending on the
            player's hunger value, the corpse may drop raw human meat, which can be eaten or cooked into long pork.
          </p>

          <h2 id="loot-bags">Loot Bags</h2>
          <p>
            When a corpse or sleeping player is killed/harvested while they had items in their inventory, a loot bag will spawn in their place. The loot bag is simply a container for items.
            Like the corpse, items can only be removed from the loot bag, they cannot be readded. When a loot bag despawns, it will drop all the items it was holding.
