            Scraps introduces a variety of new guns to the game. Some guns, like the Homemade Gun, can be crafted in a vanilla crafting table.
            However, most guns require a <a href="/scraps/guide/stations/crafting#workbench">Workbench</a> or <a href="/scraps/guide/stations/crafting#workstation">Workstation</a>
            to craft. All guns require Netherite to craft. Guns can be repaired in a <a href="/scraps/guide/stations/repair-station">Repair Station</a>.

            With the gun in your main hand, R+Click to fire, and L+Click to reload. Additionally, if your gun is a Sniper, SHIFT to toggle between Zoom modes.
            When reloading your gun, ensure that you have enough suitable ammunition in your inventory to reload with. By hovering over your gun in the inventory, you can
            view the currently loaded ammunition (if any). Your gun will automatically try to reload the same type of ammo when you reload. To unload a gun, hover over it
            in the inventory and press CTRL+Q. Otherwise, use the command '/unload' while holding the gun in your main hand. Unloading a gun while it is empty will remove
            any equipped attachments from it. To equip an attachment, simply open your inventory and click the attachment onto the gun you want to equip it to.
          </p>

          <h2 id="types">Types</h2>
          <p>
            The main types of guns in Scraps are: pistols, shotguns, SMGs, rifles, sniper rifles, the rocket launcher, and the grenade launcher.
            Each type is associated with an ammo category. For example, Pistols only accept pistol ammo, Rifles only accept rifle ammo, etc.
            Most gun types (groups) have low-tier members, intermediate members, and high-tier members. For example, SMGs have a low-tier member, the
            Thompson, an intermediate member, the MPX, and finally a high-tier member, the P90. Lower-tier guns are usually cheaper or can be made
            in a workbench rather than a workstation, and higher-tier guns are usually more expensive and require a workstation. Higher-tier guns usually
            deal more damage, have a better fire-rate, and have higher durability.
          </p>

          <h2 id="ammo">Ammo</h2>
          <h3 id="ammo-attributes">Attributes</h3>
          <p>
            Weapon ammunition in Scraps can take multiple forms. Ammo is considered any item that can be loaded into a weapon and used as a projectile.
            Ammo types will display all information about them in their item lore. For example, some ammo types deal extra damage. To calculate how much damage
            an ammo will do when fired, simply multiply the base damage value of the gun (Which can be viewed in the gun lore) by any damage modifiers
            the ammo have. Some ammo types will shoot multiple projectiles, in which case the damage value shown in the lore will apply to each individual pellet.
            (This is why shotgun shells show a '90%' decrease in damage; the damage is per-pellet).
          </p>
          <h3 id="ammo-effects">Effects</h3>
          <p>
            Certain ammo types have special attributes, called 'Projectile Effects' associated with them, which describe what happens when the projectile hits.
            Additionally, some ammo types have 'Transient Effects' which describe how the projectile ricochets or penetrates a target.
            Finally, some ammo types are 'armor-piercing'. This means that the projectile will mostly ignore armor points when inflicting damage on a target.
            This can be highly useful in the later stages of the game, as high-tier enchanted armor can greatly reduce incoming damage from non armor-piercing
            bullets.
          </p>
          <h3 id="heavy">Heavy Ammo</h3>
          <p>
            Rockets and Grenade Rounds (Not to be confused with <a href="./grenades">Grenades</a>) are ammunition types in Scraps.
            Rockets can only be fired when loaded into a Rocket Launcher; likewise Grenade Rounds can only be fired when loaded into a Grenade Launcher.
            Rockets and Grenade Rounds also have explosive variants which can be used to raid, in a similar fashion to explosive rifle rounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            It should be noted that rockets are 'self-propelled', meaning that unlike regular guns, they will continue to accelerate when fired.
          </p>

          <h2 id="attachments">Attachments</h2>
          <p>
            Attachments are items that can be equipped to a gun to modify it. Attachments will describe their function, and what guns they can be attached to in
            their item lore. See <a href="#controls">Controls</a> to learn how to equip and remove attachments to/from your gun.
          </p>

          <h2 id="armor">Armor</h2>
          <p>
            In order to protect yourself against gunfire, you must wear armor. Armor points will reduce the amount of incoming damage from most bullets, except for
            Armor Piercing rounds, like rifle bullets and shotgun slugs. Enchanting your armor, especially with Projectile Protection, will improve its effectiveness
            significantly. The damage you deal to other players and entities with guns/projectiles can be measured by using the '/combatlog' command.
