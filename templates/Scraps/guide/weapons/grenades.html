            Grenades are a new type of explosive weapon in Scraps. Grenades are a type of 'PvP-Explosive', which means they don't deal damage to blocks, but
            will deal damage to players and entities. Grenades can have projectile effects, similar to <a href="./guns">Ammunition</a>.
            Like bullets, grenades may bounce, or ricochet, when they hit the ground.

            Like raid explosives, grenades have an explosive yield value which can be viewed in their item lore. This determines the size, and therefore damage, of the explosion.
            While holding the grenade, use R+Click to 'toss' the grenade a short distance in front of you. Otherwise, use L+Click to 'charge throw' the grenade. When pressing L+Click,
            a charge bar will appear above your hotbar, which will quickly fill up. Press R+Click to throw the grenade with the force shown on the charge bar. However, don't charge the
            grenade for too long, or it will drop from your hand and activate on you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grenades like the Fragmentation Grenade and Pipe Bomb will spawn shrapnel when they detonate. Shrapnel is similar to bullets, and will deal a lot of damage if it manages
            to hit a player or entity. Shrapnel is evenly distributed in a sphere around the grenade, and despawns almost immediately, unlike a bullet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grenades have fuses, or time delays before they detonate. Once the grenade is thrown, the fuse will begin to run down even while the grenade flies through the air. This means
            that in some cases, a grenade can be thrown in such a way that it detonates before hitting the ground, which can be advantageous in some situations. However, certain grenades
            detonate on impact.
