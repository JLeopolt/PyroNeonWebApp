  <h1>
    Server Rules
  </h1>
  <p>
        1. In order to keep the game fun and fair for everyone, do not use any modified or unapproved client.
     Do not use any hacks, such as: x-ray, kill-aura, free-cam, any auto-clicker or macro, auto-mining bots, etc.
     Using any of these modifications may result in a permanent ban, at the discretion of the moderator team.<br><br>

    2. Do not attempt to evade bans or punishments using an alt account or VPN. Regardless of the original punishment, ban evasion
     will result in a permanent ban across all accounts and IP addresses involved.<br><br>

    3. PyroNeon Software will not be compelled to remove any player-generated content that is an expression of belief or free speech.
     However, PyroNeon Software reserves the right to remove player-generated content if we find it in violation of the server rules.<br><br>

    4. Player-generated content may be removed or censored only if it violates someone else's privacy. For example, publicly announcing another player's
     IP address in the chat or their real-world address would be considered a violation of their privacy and safety.<br><br>

    5. In-game items or content obtained directly or indirectly from client modifications (See Rule 1) are subject to confiscation by the admin team,
     regardless of how it came into a player's possession.<br><br>

    6. Members of the admin team may not abuse their privileges. If an admin is proven to be abusing privileges, whether to gain an unfair advantage
     in the game, or to punish players without cause, their privileges may be revoked, and they may be suspended from the server.<br><br>

    7. Flooding the chat with messages may result in your chatting privileges being revoked.<br><br>

    8. Purposefully attempting to lag the server is against the rules. A 'lag' machine may be recognized at discretion of the moderation team,
     and punishment may be given depending on severity, repeat offenses, or intentions.<br><br>

    9. If you discover a bug, please report it to administration as soon as possible. You may be permitted to exploit it until it's patched, or
     you may be instructed to stop exploiting it, at the discretion of the admin team. You will not be punished for discovering or exploiting a
     bug that has been reported to the admin team, unless the administration declared a punishment for exploiting it.<br><br>
  </p>

  <h1>
    Terms of Service
  </h1>
  <p>
    By logging onto our server, you agree to the following terms and conditions. <br><br>

    Any information you generate or provide including accounts, IP addresses, chat messages, in-game activity, in-game content like buildings, signs,

    kept private, but other content such as your in-game creations may be shared online. Obviously, PyroNeon Software takes no responsibility for any information
    you publicly provide or announce in the server being kept private by other players. <br><br>

    Violations of our server policy may result in restrictions on your gameplay, or a suspension of your ability to log in. It is assumed that if you log
    into our server, you will obey our server policies, and if you are found in violation of those policies; you may be subject to punishment as outlined
    in our publicly-available server rules. By logging into the server, you confirm that you understand the rules and will be held accountable to any violations
    you commit. <br><br>
