    Features
  </h1>
  <p>
    MUD offers native support for YouTube videos, giving you full control over what streams to use when downloading, output file types, etc.
    MUD is also able to scan the HTML contents of a website you provide, and pick out video files straight from the source, so you can download
    anything without having to sign up for an account.
