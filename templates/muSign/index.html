    About
  </h1>
  <p>
    μSign (pronounced muSign) is an open-source, lightweight GUI .EXE signing python program. If you're a developer compiling code into an .EXE binary file for
    distribution online, you may have encountered issues with Windows and antivirus programs falsely blocking your app from running. With μSign, you can secure
    your program and allow users to use it without restriction again. Additionally, by signing your files, clients can verify the authenticity of your program,
    and ensure they are using a legitimate, unmodified copy of your software.

    Features
  </h1>
  <p>
    μSign supports signing regular EXE files, as well as Java compiled EXE files.
    μSign is extremely lightweight, and a barebones piece of software. There is no junk or bloat included in the program.
    Once you run the program, you can immediately start signing any .EXE files you have. Additionally, you can save and load
    configurations, to automate repetitive signing every time you release a new version of your program.
