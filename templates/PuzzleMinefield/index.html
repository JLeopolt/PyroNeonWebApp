    <p>
      Puzzle Minefield is a classic puzzle solving game,
      with enhancements such as cross-platform gameplay,
      and online progress tracking, but chiefly: Competitive Multiplayer
      gameplay. Play head to head with others in random matches for ranks

      It's easy to learn how to play! There are only 3 different controls
      you need to know, Left Click, Right Click, and Middle Click.
      Enjoy playing through and honing your skills by competing against
      others online. Although it's easy to learn, it's difficult to master
      with increasingly skilled players facing you and more difficult boards
      to solve.
