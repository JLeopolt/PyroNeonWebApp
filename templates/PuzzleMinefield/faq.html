        Frequently Asked Questions
      </h1>

      <h3>
        What platforms can I play on?
      </h3>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
          Desktop, Android, and Web versions are currently planned.
          However, currently, only Desktop is supported. Any desktop
          that can run Java should be able to support the game.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>
        Do I download the .JAR or .EXE?
      </h3>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
          The Jar file is for computers with Java installed.
          If you're running Windows, you can install the .EXE file.
          There isn't a difference, but the EXE doesn't require
          Java to be installed on your computer.

      <h3>
        Is it free to play?
      </h3>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
          Puzzle Minefield will always be free to play.
          In the future, there may be optional cosmetics or other
          bonus features for sale. On some platforms, you may
          have the choice to watch ads for in-game rewards.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>
        How do I make an account?
      </h3>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
          Currently, as of the Alpha release, accounts
          are not implemented. There are no experience
          or ELO metrics to track, and no official online
          matchmaking servers.
        </p>
